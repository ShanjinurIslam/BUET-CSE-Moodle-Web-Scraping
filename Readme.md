# BUET CSE MOODLE API

In this project my primary target is to

1. Parse HTMLDocument that is primarily designed for the website
2. Make API out of it
3. Introduce a mobile app to use these APIs

In this project for the first time I have done full app in swift ui

This is an amazing framework, much better than Storyboard based solutions
Most importantly, dynamic content loading is very good.
